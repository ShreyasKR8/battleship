                <b>Objective</b>: Sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. Players take turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships by selecting cells to "attack."
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Placing Ships</b>: At the start, each player places their ships on their own grid, either manually or randomly. Ships must be placed horizontally or vertically and cannot overlap or extend beyond the grid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Gameplay</b>: On your turn:
                <ul class='gameplay-rules'>
                    <li>Choose a cell on your opponent's board to attack.</li>
                    <li>If you hit a ship, it is marked, and you can attempt to sink it by hitting all its parts.</li>
                    <li>The game ends when all parts of one player's ships are destroyed.</li>
